This repo is just a demonstration in creating a hash table in C. Mostly for personal practice since I am much more comfortable with linked-lists as a data structure, but have not really done much with hash tables. Feel free to utilize it if you'd like, but there are likely much better versions out there as well.  I gotta get employed somehow so :D
